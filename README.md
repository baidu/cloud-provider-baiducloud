# CCE Cloud Controller Manager(CCM)

**cce-cloud-controller-manager** is a Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager implementation (or out-of-tree cloud-provider) for Cloud-Container-Engine(CCE) on BCE.

## Introduction

External cloud providers were introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.6 with the addition of the Cloud Controller Manager binary. External cloud providers are Kubernetes (master) controllers that implement the cloud-provider specific control loops required for Kubernetes to function.

This functionality is implemented in-tree in the kube-controller-manger binary for existing cloud-providers (e.g. AWS, GCE, etc.), however, in-tree cloud-providers have entered maintenance mode and no additional providers will be accepted. Furthermore, there is an ongoing effort to remove all existing cloud-provider specific code out of the Kubernetes codebase.
